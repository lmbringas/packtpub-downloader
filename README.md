# PacktPub DownloaderScript to download all your PacktPub books inspired by https://github.com/ozzieperez/packtpub-library-downloaderSince PacktPub restructured their website [packtpub-library-downloader](https://github.com/ozzieperez/packtpub-library-downloader) became obsolete because the downloader used webscraping. So I figured out that now PacktPub uses a REST API. Then I found which endpoint to use for downloading books and made a simple script. Feel free to fork and PR to improve. Packtpub's API isn't documented :'(## Usage:    pip install -r requirements.txt	python main.py -e <email> -p <password> [-d <directory> -b <book file types> -s -v -q]##### Example: Download books in PDF format	python main.py -e hello@world.com -p p@ssw0rd -d ~/Desktop/packt -b pdf,epub,mobi,code## Commandline Options- *-e*, *--email* = Your login email- *-p*, *--password* = Your login password- *-d*, *--directory* = Directory to download into. Default is "media/" in the current directory- *-b*, *--books* = Assets to download. Options are: *pdf,mobi,epub,code*- *-l*, *--parallel* = Download the books in parallel (implies *-q*)- *-s*, *--separate* = Create a separate directory for each book- *-v*, *--verbose* = Show more detailed information- *-q*, *--quiet* = Don't show information or progress bars    Please note that *-v* and *-q* override each other; the last argument passed to the script will be used.**Book File Types**- *pdf*: PDF format- *mobi*: MOBI format- *epub*: EPUB format- *code*: Accompanying source code, saved as .zip filesI'm working on Python 3.6.0
