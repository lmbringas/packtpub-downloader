# PacktPub Downloader

Script to download all your PacktPub books inspired by https://github.com/ozzieperez/packtpub-library-downloader

Since PacktPub restructured their website [packtpub-library-downloader](https://github.com/ozzieperez/packtpub-library-downloader) became obsolete because the downloader used webscraping. So I figured out that now PacktPub uses a REST API. Then I found which endpoint to use for downloading books and made a simple script. Feel free to fork and PR to improve. Packtpub's API isn't documented :'(

## Usage:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
	python main.py -e <email> -p <password> [-d <directory> -b <book file types> -s -v -q]

##### Example: Download books in PDF format
	python main.py -e hello@world.com -p p@ssw0rd -d ~/Desktop/packt -b pdf,epub,mobi,code

## Docker integration

You must put your data in the `.env` file. 

```
mv data.env-sample data.env
```

and replace the sample data with your login credentials.

```
docker-compose up
```

After the execution, you can see the content in the `book` directory.
